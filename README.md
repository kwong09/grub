## Otter Eats
The purpose of this website was to participate in Hack Club's Grub event (yum!). I took inspiration from my friend Ara's love for otters and food to create this website! Please enjoy the menu and all of the different features that I added :)

# How Did You Make This?
I used HTML and Tailwind CSS (my first time :O) throughout the entirety of the website. Any hand-drawn icons were made by me (Kayla) on my iPad. I use an iPad Air, Apple Pencil, and Procreate to make the drawings.

# Features of the Website
Most of the features were just to fulfill some requirements for Grub. I included a navigation bar, a sidebar (on the menu page), a footer, various buttons, a FAQ section, and an About section! I will still be making updates to the page to make it more personalized! Enjoy!!
